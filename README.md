# FINFET Characteristic And Realisation Of Inverter Using FINFETS Using Ngspice
### What is Finfet?
<p>FinFET stands for Fin Field-Effect Transistor. It's a type of transistor architecture used in integrated circuits (ICs), 
  particularly in semiconductor manufacturing processes for digital CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) devices. 
  FinFETs offer significant advantages over traditional planar CMOS transistors, especially in terms of power efficiency and performance.
</p>
<p>The key feature of FinFETs is the fin-shaped channel that protrudes from the substrate, allowing for better control of the flow of current. 
  This design helps to reduce leakage current, improve transistor switching speed, and enhance overall performance. 
  FinFETs are commonly used in modern semiconductor processes, including those used for manufacturing CPUs, GPUs, and other advanced digital ICs.</p>
<p>FinFET technology has been widely adopted in the semiconductor industry and is commercially available through various semiconductor foundries and manufacturers. 
  Companies like Intel, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and others have been offering FinFET-based processes for several years.
</p>
<p>These companies provide FinFET technology at various nodes, such as 14nm, 10nm, 7nm, and even smaller nodes like 5nm and 3nm. 
  Each generation of FinFET technology offers improvements in power efficiency, performance, and transistor density, enabling the development of more powerful and energy-efficient electronic devices.
</p>
<p>Commercially available FinFET technology has enabled the production of high-performance CPUs, GPUs,
  mobile SoCs (System-on-Chips), and other advanced semiconductor devices used in smartphones, computers, networking equipment, automotive electronics, and many other applications</p>
